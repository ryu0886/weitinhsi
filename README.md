# weitinhsi

The weitinhsi is a system to generate automatically events for the Windows sample such as PE file, MS Word, batch files and so on.
Instead of using patch API, the core module "minidbg.exe" simulates the debugger to install break points and monitors certain APIs. The API list can be defined by the configuration.
